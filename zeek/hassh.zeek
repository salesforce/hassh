# Description:  This Zeek script appends hassh data to ssh.log       #
#               by enumerating the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packets sent      #
#               as clear text between the client and server as part  # 
#               of the negotiation of an SSH connection.             #
#                                                                    #
