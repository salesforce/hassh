# A dockerized version of hassh.py can be used to extract HASSH fingerprints from input PCAP files and live network traffic.
#
# Build the docker image using Dockerfile:
#   $ docker build -t hassh:latest .
# - Reading from input PCAP files:
#    You can mount your host ~/pcap dir to copy pcap files to the container and also keep the logs on your host:
#      $ docker run -v ~/pcap:/tmp/ -it hassh:latest -d /tmp/ -l json -o /tmp/log.json
# - Live network traffic capture:
#      $ docker run --net=host -it hassh:latest -i any --print
# Note: According to Docker's docs, the host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and is not supported on Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, or Docker EE for Windows Server.
